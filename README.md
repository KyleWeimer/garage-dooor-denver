# README

Here we go. This is my first project on Rails! I am creating a website for a [Denver Garage Door Repair](http://www.gbrothersgaragedoors.com) client and he is super stoked for me to get this Ruby on the Rails!

I have very limited experience on Rails as compared to my expertise working with garage door service companies near me. I actually know at least seven garage door service company owners that I can count that work in the Denver Metro area, to include Aurora, Parker, Wheat Ridge, Golden, Boulder, and Broomfield.  

I build most of my client websites in Wordpress, so I hope that I can put out a product that he and I can both be proud of. I’m excited to test the SEO capabilities of the Ruby platform and see how it matches up to Wordpress for ranking some extremely tough niches such as [Garage Door Service Denver](http://www.gbrothersgaragedoors.com).

Garage Door Denver – why it’s important

I’ve been working with my local Garage Door Denver client for over six months and we have generated a ton of leads, most of which come from paid ads using Google Adwords and Facebook Ads, and during that time I’ve learned that the two most important search terms for my client are [Garage Door Denver](http://www.gbrothersgaragedoors.com) and Garage Door Repair Denver.

Knowing this importance and applying it has really enabled me to hone in on his ideal client and get this search engine ranking done!
